Over the past decade, predictions about the future of technology have been dominated by one central idea: the internet will radically reshape our lives. I used to follow this conversation closely, listening to podcasts and reading articles from technology experts who confidently announced that a new revolution was just around the corner. Yet, as time passes, it has become increasingly clear to me that many of these predictions were exaggerated. The internet may be powerful, but its supposed transformation of everyday life is not happening as dramatically as promised.

Take, for example, the Internet of Things (IoT). Around six years ago, it was hailed as the next big breakthrough. Experts claimed that everything—from refrigerators to cars to toothbrushes—would be connected to the internet, constantly communicating and improving our daily routines. In reality, IoT has not lived up to this vision. Yes, we have smart speakers and connected devices, but they are often more gimmicky than revolutionary. They do not fundamentally reshape how people live, and adoption remains limited.

Artificial intelligence was also framed as a natural outcome of internet-driven progress. The argument was simple: as more data is collected, AI would become an indispensable part of our lives. While AI tools like ChatGPT or recommendation systems are increasingly present, their impact is not as world-altering as once imagined. Most people still use AI in relatively narrow ways—search, entertainment, or work assistance—rather than as a transformative force in their personal lives.

Another prediction was the rise of personalization. Experts imagined a future where every online experience, from shopping to education, would be perfectly tailored to each individual. While algorithms do provide some degree of personalization—recommendations on YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix, for example—this is far from the deep, individualized world that was envisioned. Personalization often feels shallow, sometimes even manipulative, serving companies’ advertising models more than the user’s needs.

Cryptocurrencies and decentralization tell a similar story. In the late 2010s, advocates promised a financial revolution: traditional banks would disappear, transactions would be peer-to-peer, and digital coins would replace national currencies. Instead, crypto has struggled with volatility, regulation, and limited real-world application. While it has certainly made headlines, it has not become the everyday currency of the future.

For these reasons, I believe internet technologies are among the most overrated innovations of our time. They generate excitement and bold predictions, but they do not gain enough traction to truly reshape ordinary life. The revolution, if it ever comes, is still far away. Instead of constantly waiting for an internet-driven utopia, perhaps it is time to take a more realistic look at how technology actually integrates into society—slowly, unevenly, and often less dramatically than expected.
