**Cross-linguistic Sound-symbolism: How Cultural Perception Shapes Word Forms**
 
Abdulkadir Şenel - Gaziantep University
 
**Abstract**

 
Words are one of the fundamental parts of language, and the processes that shape their forms have long been discussed throughout history. In the 20th century, Saussure’s claim of arbitrariness gained strong ground. According to arbitrariness, there is no connection between a word’s form and its meaning. Saussure argued that if there were such a connection, there should not be different words for the same object. However, Saussure and his followers overlooked an important point that the words are different because they represent different things in their culture. Even though dog, köpek, hund, kelp have the same dictionary meaning, they represent very different things in their native lands, in their culture. A cultural analysis of the connection between word form and meaning shows clear correlations that indicate sound-symbolic associations. Moreover, not only Saussure but also many sound symbolism studies have overlooked the cultural significance of words and limited themselves to dictionary meanings. Word forms are not a reflection of their meaning in the dictionary, rather they are a reflection of words’ meaning in the minds of its user. By considering cultural aspects, sound symbolism can gain stronger ground and greater significance.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this study emphasizes that words cannot be understood in isolation from the world they integrated in. The examples examined provide strong evidence of a connection between a word’s meaning and its form. Even if we cannot trace exactly how these words were shaped originally, the similarities and differences across cultures reveal clear patterns that suggest sound-symbolic associations. Furthermore, future research on sound symbolism should take into account the interconnectedness of words with their cultural contexts. By doing so, such studies can more convincingly highlight iconicity as a fundamental feature of language, showing how word forms reflect perception, culture, and human experience.
