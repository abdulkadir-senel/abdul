This case study is an analysis of a science student’s self-directed English language learning which is a profoundly essential necessity of the modern world’s internet. Throughout the article we will explore the 2 year process systematically into 4 stages. We will start with goals that put forward and assessment method for tracking improvement. Subsequently we will dive into methodology which is consistent with analysing tools, materials and techniques and effectiveness of them that are used across processes. Afterwards, we will look into challenges that cause difficulties and how and what type of solutions developed. At the end, the study will outline the short conclusion part.
Initial Assessment and Goals
The learner, who is a high school graduated science student initiated with very limited competency in the English language. Receptive skills were minimal and productive skills were insufficient. Potentially, the learner was upper-elementary (A1+) level at CEFR proficiency level scale. The initial goals decided as follows;
Improve reading proficiency to at least understanding daily articles in 6 months
Take 65 point in YDT(foreign language test for university entrance) exam in 1 year
At a later stage, after passing the university entrance exam, goals were changed according to professional needs.
Fluent speaking
Minimal error in pronunciation
Analysing current circumstances shows that the most important skill among 4 skills was speaking skills which is at the same time one of the most demanding skills to improve.
Methodology
The learner of the study employed different strategies throughout his acquisition process.
Resource:
Avoided any English grammar specific book, but adopted and took advantage of Middle East Technical Universitie’s preparatory year book, “Reader at Work 1” extensively.
Newsinlevels.com followed and translated most of the articles and the stories at that website.
Technique:
Spaced repetition and extensive reading were the centre of the acquisition process.
On behalf of speaking practice, voice recording was conducted for a prolonged period. The content of voice journaling sessions which the student gave this name to, were at first coming from the daily experiences, later the student was generating questions from AI softwares.
This methodology derived from the learner’s needs and his weak and strong aspects. Additionally, methodology changed whenever necessary. Particularly, after some cornerstones, for example university exams, methodology changed according to new circumstances.
Challenges
The learner faced different obstacles throughout the acquisition process. They were from different sources, including the learner’s internal factors and external factors.
Internal factors
Motivation towards learning language was fluctuating throughout the process. But the learner achieved to keep fundamental practices’s consistency.
Being young was one of the struggle points. Because, the learner’s attention was going to entertainment oriented sources. This was decreasing his language studying time.
External factors
The environmental changes due to pandemic and acceptance at university were at some point causing difficulties.
Some interpersonal relationships affecting learner motivation, eg. Family, friends.
Despite all these problems, the learner managed to maintain consistency and continue improvement thanks to keeping tasks manageable and achievable .
Conclusion
This case study investigated a science student’s self-directed English language learning process, highlighting adopted methodologies and faced challenges along with assessment and goals. Despite external and internal obstacles,the learner was able to maintain consistent progress by manageable tasks. While this paper is restricted to one’s individual experiences, it can be beneficial for similar learner’s. Lastly, a more detailed and expanded applicable version of this study could give more influential strategies.
