- these are my thoughts and ideas. they can wrong at all.

Chomsky says that there is a language program in our brain. It has been there since our birth. This program is specialized for language learning. How did Chomsky come up with this idea? There are two very important observations that led Chomsky to this idea.

1. All languages around the world are so similar. Furthermore, he came up with the X-bar theory, which states that all phrases in all languages follow one rule. Linguists have surpassed physics in this regard. Chomsky found the string theory of linguistics: XP → {(spec) X-bar YP*}. Every sentence, every phrase — “nasartu,” “the sunny day,” “gittim,” “mine zavut Abdul” — all of them have to apply this rule. This is an incredible exploration. Because every language is the same, it is most probable that to aliens, we are speaking the same language with different variations. Since all these languages come from different brains, this means that all brains around the world have something in common. This is the language program. (By the way, there is no silent community; all communities around the world have complex languages.) Also, sign languages share this theory.
2. There isn’t sufficient input for infants to create such immense and unique outputs. It is clear that infants do not memorize their parents’ speech and later remember and utter them. Instead, parents give infants the necessary gradients for their language program to use. Without these gradients/inputs, children cannot learn language. The innate language program needs gradients. Moreover, there is a term called “creolization,” meaning that infants turn pidgin language into creole. Let’s simplify: infants, babies, turn simple basic language into complex, full-fledged language. Actually, nearly all children do this. All moms speak to their children in “motherese,” which is a simplified version. Creolization is also a strong indicator of an innate organ that needs complex language. Maybe we need complex language to express our ideas. This is evidence of some program in our brain that makes us acquire language.

So, the fact that all languages are similar indicates a common language organ in all people’s minds around the globe. Also, the insufficient input from parents for children, but still, they learn language, indicates that there really is an innate language program that makes us learn language.

Additionally, there are many experiments and observations with language-impaired people that show us that there is really a certain region in the brain that works specifically for linguistic purposes.

Let’s talk about this program — the language program.

What does this program need to run? There should be a healthy brain that consists of the language organ program. This is the first necessity. We know that this program does not need all phrases; just a few ingredients are enough for it to work. But how much ingredient is enough?

From the creolization period, we know that pidgin languages are simple, primitive languages. Their syntax and sentence order don’t apply the X-bar theory. They do not follow sentence order. They put words where they want. Secondly, they do not have consistent time indication or prefixes or suffixes. These things make pidgin a non-complex, non-full-fledged language. Simply, pidgin doesn’t have grammar. But we know that they have plenty of words.

A baby’s brain uses these words as ingredients, and they utter complex sentences. They indicate time and different prepositions in their sentences. They show consistent grammatical rules in their sentences. But they did not hear any of these grammatical rules from their parents. So, as we said, this shows that there is a grammar/language program in the brain that comes from birth — it is innate. Pidgin language gave their babies words, and babies use these words to make full-fledged language.

If babies do not get any words, can they still do this? Can they still invent language?

We know some severe real-life cases (not experiments). In usa, a psychopathic parent locked his child in a basement and did not talk to her. When this child was able to get out, she was 13 years old. She could not speak anything. Even under heavy psychotherapy, she still could not show language ability.

So, does this mean that without words, we cannot show language ability?

There is another very interesting case. In Nicaragua, until the 1970s, there wasn’t any deaf school. Deaf people were isolated. Some were learning lip reading. But lip reading is not language for them. Because they are deaf, the brain uses visual data as input for the language program, and their output is visual with their hands. So, lip reading does not help them at all. In the 1970s, a deaf school opened. But the education was still focused on lip reading and pantomime-style hand movements. So, this was not sufficient for children to acquire language. But something very strange happened. In the playground and on the bus, deaf children were inventing their own language — a full-fledged, complex language with time indicators, prepositions, and sentence structure rules. They invented a full-fledged language on their own. They are kids. Did their grammar gene invent language while socializing?

So, is the main and only necessary ingredient for the language organ to invent or acquire language just socializing?

The key part is this: Nicaraguan children were using some pantomime-style movements as input while inventing language. So, we don’t know if two infants without external input would be able to invent language.
