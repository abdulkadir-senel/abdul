If you just want to read fast without understanding what you read, you can pay for speed reading courses. But fast understanding is impossible because seeing a word is fast, but transferring that word from short-term memory to working memory takes time. Let’s simplify it: you can see a word in just 50 ms, but giving meaning to what you saw takes 350 ms.
If we show you a word for just 50 ms, you can understand it — not instantly, but after 350 ms, you will comprehend it. However, if we show you words one by one with only a 50 ms gap between them, you cannot understand them because they will fill your short-term memory, and before you can assign meaning to them, you will forget them.
So, speed reading is bullshit. Those who promote these things are either frauds or bad people, or they are ignorant, which still makes them bad people. Because if you sell something related to speed reading, you need to promote it with information, and while gathering that information, it is impossible not to come across the truth about speed reading.
Instead of spending money on speed reading, spend money on buying time. You will need more time to understand something.
I read an article about how to understand things. In short, it said that reading a lot does not make you smarter — understanding things does. For me, understanding one book is more important than reading 100 books, even if reading that one book takes my whole year. At least I will have learned one thing, which is infinitely better than learning nothing.
