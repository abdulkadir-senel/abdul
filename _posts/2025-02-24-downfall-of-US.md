I am so happy about the current state of the USA. There is chaos, and the government is so unstable that no investor would be willing to invest in the country anymore.

There are many problems happening in America, which show that the country is in decline. The U.S. government is making budget cuts, including public sector cuts, to save money. This clearly indicates that the U.S. is in a bad economic situation. However, cutting budgets is not a solution. There is a fundamental rule in the world: if you want more money, you need to spend. A very obvious example is Mr. Beast. He was poor but became extremely rich by giving money to others and reinvesting all his earnings into his work. He is well known for his generosity. The rule is simple — if you want more money, you need to give or spend. While we cannot scientifically prove this 100%, it clearly works.

On a governmental level, we can explain why spending, rather than cutting, makes a government richer. First, investment in infrastructure and institutions makes people happy and builds trust in the government. Moreover, when a government spends money and works hard for its country, its citizens recognize this effort and feel motivated to work harder in return. If 300 million people work hard, it is impossible not to grow. But people see the opposite happening — they feel insecure and unwilling to put in extra effort for their government.

However, the U.S. government is doing the opposite. It is laying off tens of thousands of government employees, shutting down state institutions such as the Department of Education, and cutting budgets for other departments. At the same time, it is outsourcing tasks to private institutions, allowing them to profit from government work. Furthermore, the government is decreasing its transparency and accountability. People are aware of this situation, as seen in their reactions.

On February 20, *The Guardian* published an article whose headline perfectly highlighted the downfall of the U.S.: “Trump Cuts Funding for Science.” Science has been the backbone of the West’s dominance, and now researchers are planning to leave the U.S. This means that whichever country becomes the new hub for science will likely be the next global power.

Additionally, the U.S. government’s anti-immigration policies show how ruthless and short-sighted it has become. Everyone knows that Western societies are experiencing a significant population decline. Without a strong workforce, no government can achieve economic growth.

On the other hand, in Europe, Spain had the best economy in 2024, according to *The Economist*, with a 2.4% growth rate compared to Britain’s 0.9% and France’s 0.1%. Spain achieved this through pro-immigration policies and socialist-led governance. What is socialist-led governance? Simply put, it means spending money on people and for people, investing in public institutions, and creating job opportunities. Spain had an aging population, but with its immigration policies, it increased its workforce. Combined with strong tourism revenues, the country is growing. Its people are happy, tourists are happy, and this cycle attracts more tourists, leading to more money, more investment in people, and an even happier Spain.

Anyway, there are a lot of bad things happening in the U.S.
