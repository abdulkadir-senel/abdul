At the internet, bookstores, café shops, and the dinner table — what is the common thing among these? These places can include something about AI. There are a lot of books about AI. People write books and articles or read about AI in cafés. Even family conversations at the dinner table can be about AI. People say AI is the start of a new age, a new historical moment. They say AI will rewrite history. They claim AI is the thing that changes everything.
But what is AI? Is it really such an extraordinary and powerful thing that can fulfill these promises? At least, does it have the potential to do so?
Artificial intelligence is not intelligence at all. It is just a word combinator. It puts words in order according to probability. The same goes for AI-generated images; they color pixels according to probability. It does not understand or learn anything. It just places words in order accordingly. For example, if you type “hello” into an AI chatbot, it analyzes its dataset and responds with the best possible option: “Hey, Abdulkadir, how’s it going?” It does not create anything itself. It just looks at its dataset and finds where “hello” appears, then checks what usually comes after it — maybe “Hello, Elon, how are you?” — and gives you something similar. That’s why AI requires an enormous amount of power to process every chat.
So, which part of this is the revolution that will shape the world? The internet shaped the world; it changed it deeply. AI has been changing business, commerce, and the software sector for the last 10–15 years. Especially with chatbots, it has touched — if not completely changed — many people’s lives. However, AI is not revolutionary. No. AI is just a word-ordering tool for most people. It is not even close to being truly intelligent. It is a complex tool, but nothing extraordinary or different, not like the internet.
But the future of the internet is going to be dark. I will share my thoughts about the perished history of the internet and the reasons behind it.
I don’t know why people are so hyped about AI — not just regular people, but even big tech companies.
Sam Altman talks about AGI — Artificial General Intelligence, something that has the ability to understand and learn. He says AGI will come out very soon, in a year. But this is impossible. They most likely say this to keep the money flowing from investors. Don’t let the complexity and skills of current AI tools fool you. AI and AGI are very, very different things. The difference is like that between the human brain and a computer processor. It is that big.
