It is not that bold of a take because the internet is easily controllable. Unlike books, which can be distributed even under heavy restrictions, the internet depends on physical infrastructure. If a government cuts the cables or disables satellites, access can be completely shut down. Books, on the other hand, are widely distributed, and there is no single point of failure. The internet relies on data centers and their connections to users, making it vulnerable. North Korea has successfully restricted internet access, but do you think they have been equally successful in restricting books? I compare books with the internet because both are major breakthroughs in the distribution of information.
The existence of the internet, as we know it, is relatively recent. While it was invented decades ago, it has only deeply influenced people’s lives for about 20 years. However, I don’t think it will last another 20 years in its current form. The future of the internet looks dark, especially with the rise of authoritarian regimes that oppose the free flow of information — especially information that threatens their control. We have seen how China and North Korea restrict access, and now we are witnessing the rise of authoritarian tendencies in the West, which is the hub of the internet.
What led me to this thought? In God’s book, there are many references to the importance of pens, wisdom, ships, and other crucial elements of civilization. The frequent mention of ships caught my attention. From 1,400 years ago until today, ships have remained essential to society and the economy. This suggests that God’s book highlights things of lasting importance. It mentions pens, books, ships, bees, morality, politics, and war, but I have not found any reference — direct or indirect — to the internet or the modern distribution of information. If the internet were to remain as central to human life as it is today, wouldn’t there be at least some mention or implication of its significance?
This makes me question whether the internet is truly as important and permanent as we think. It seems highly possible that it will decline in prominence. Governments worldwide are discussing internet restrictions, particularly regarding age limits. At the same time, people are becoming more aware of the negative effects of the internet, especially the psychological, political, and social consequences of social media. Many individuals are trying to quit social media and break free from internet addiction.
Moreover, the internet poses a significant threat to governments, particularly authoritarian ones. People use it to organize protests and anti-regime activities. Additionally, much of modern governments’ critical and non-critical information is stored online, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Some governments are even planning cyberattacks against their rivals. Given the rise of authoritarian regimes, this provides a clue about the future of technology. For these regimes, security is the top priority, and anything that threatens it will be targeted. This includes external threats — such as surveillance software from China, the US, and Russia — as well as internal threats, like citizens using the internet to mobilize against the government. Authoritarian governments will not tolerate such activities and will likely either cut off internet access or impose strict regulations, as we are already seeing with US restrictions on Chinese, Russian, and Iranian technology.
Beyond government control, public attitudes toward the internet are also shifting. Many people seek a more peaceful life and believe that the internet, particularly social media, contributes to their stress. Constant connectivity prevents people from finding calmness. However, the biggest threat to the internet still seems to come from governments.
