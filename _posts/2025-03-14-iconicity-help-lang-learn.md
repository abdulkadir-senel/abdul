While reading Pinker’s book *The Language Instinct* for the second time, the idea of arbitrariness caught my attention. Until that point, the book had been about universal grammar, the grammar gene, proto-proto languages, and how everything is connected. Suddenly, with arbitrariness, the connection between words and the real world was cut.

I could not believe it or understand it because it seemed so unreasonable, like indeterminism. Yes, there is indeterminism at the subatomic level, but at the human scale, everything happens due to a prior cause. Yet, arbitrariness suggests that word forms arise without any cause, particularly that the meaning of words does not affect their form.

I started studying this topic and came across iconicity, which means that word forms and meanings are connected. Word meanings resemble word forms. For example, for a spiky object, we use the word “spiky,” which resembles the spikiness of the object. Similarly, for a rounded object, we use the word “round,” which resembles the “o” shape of round things.

There are some counterarguments from arbitrariness supporters, and iconicity also has counter-counterexamples. I, myself, have a very strong counterexample to one of the most prominent arguments for arbitrariness.

But how has iconicity helped me learn language? You can guess the meaning or intention of a word using certain clues. I gave the example of spikiness and roundedness as clues. Also, when words are very long, it indicates that their meaning is complex.
