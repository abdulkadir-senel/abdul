# **The next elected party in the USA will likely be unwilling to support Israel.**

After the unexpectedly successful attack by Hamas fighters, Israel lost trust in its surveillance services, soldiers, and overall security apparatus. In an attempt to compensate for this failure, Israel launched a massive assault on Gaza. Despite doing everything possible to recover its hostages, Israel was unable to significantly weaken Hamas. Instead, they only created an illusion of Hamas being weaker than before.

Israel has admitted to killing 20,000 children and 15,000 women — totaling 50,000 civilians — and injuring more than 100,000 civilians in an effort to create civil pressure on Hamas. This act has been widely recognized and condemned worldwide as genocide. While the current U.S. government may not officially acknowledge it, there is a growing realization among the American people. Many are becoming aware of the events of the past 70 years in Palestine, especially in light of Israel’s recent genocidal attacks. Despite extensive media efforts, the brutal reality can no longer be hidden.

The probability of the next U.S. government being pro-Israel is decreasing day by day. The likely shift away from pro-Israel policies means reduced American support for Israel.

Beyond Israel’s actions, America’s focus is shifting away from the Middle East and toward the Pacific Ocean. With the growing Chinese threat and changes in global economic dynamics, the U.S. is less likely to remain deeply involved in the Middle East. Without U.S. presence in the region, Israel’s strategic importance diminishes.

# **Countries surrounding Israel are growing stronger.**

Immediately after the USA withdraws from the Middle East, Middle Eastern countries will gain a lot of power and independence. We can see this in nearly every country in the region. For example, the biggest reason why Lebanon is not strong today is the USA. The USA makes Lebanon economically dependent — not just through sanctions, but also by providing economic aid and support to the Lebanese people, which is cut off if the Lebanese government invests in its military. This makes Lebanon weak, not just against Israel but also against Iran. Iran is the biggest problem for the Middle East after the USA. A weak Lebanese government is more vulnerable to Hezbollah, an Iran-backed terrorist organization that controls part of Lebanon.

We can see what happens when both Iran and the USA leave Lebanon by looking at Syria. Syria was in a 12-year civil war. Without Iranian support for the cruel terrorist Assad regime, the people of Syria would have been able to overthrow Assad. Besides that, the USA supports the SDG, which, after the Assad regime was destroyed, continued to create problems for Syria. The SDG is a terrorist organization that poses a threat to both Syria and Turkey. Fortunately, with the collaboration of the Syrian people and Turkish intelligence services, the Assad regime was destroyed, and now Syria is free. A new Syria is rising, with deep collaboration with Turkey. Turkey is planning to deploy air defense systems in Syria, which poses significant risks to Israel.

If the USA leaves the Middle East, the region will immediately heal and become strong very quickly. Once they become stronger and estimate that they can defeat Israel, they will not hesitate even for a moment to erase Israel from the map.

# **Palestine is receiving increasing support from around the world.**

Israel has killed more than 50,000 civilians, mostly children — around 18,000 children and 15,000 women murdered by Israel in 2 years. Regardless of all efforts by Israel to cut internet and electricity in Gaza, we can see the massacre happening there. We can see the body parts of children murdered by Israeli missiles. We can see how Israeli terrorists treat the hostages like animals in camps. I mean all of the world can see this, and despite the cruel efforts of Western media agencies, all of us can see the massacre in Gaza conducted by Israel. All people are seeing this, and we will not forget it. People also will not forget this.

> I have taken several serious steps in my life for Palestinians. Generally, I wasn’t that much active on the internet, but I will share the truth of the Palestinian cause to everyone I can reach. I have already stopped buying anything related to Israel or even supporting Israel’s genocide. Besides that, I also encourage all of my friends and people around me to do the same. I started to read a lot of books about the Palestinian cause. With this information, I can defend the Palestinian cause on the internet with more accurate arguments. I generally don’t make any comments or posts about anything, but for Palestinians, I started, and I do my best. This is part of the war, and this is my task.

> *Palestinians are right with their cause. With technical tools, they are weak unfortunately, but their courage makes me more ambitious to work harder to represent and defend the Palestinian cause everywhere. Normally, I wasn’t studying 8–9 hours a day, but after the massacre, I started to study 8–9 hours every day. I need to be the best in my field, and along the way, I will talk about Palestine everywhere, especially in intellectual spheres. I will use intellectual power to support Palestinians.*

This is just one person. Millions of people have changed with the massacre of Palestinians. Millions of people hate Israel and love Palestinians. Millions of people are doing what this person is doing. Millions of people work hard for Palestinians.

In the next 5 to 10 years, at most the next 30 years, we will bear the fruit of this hard work. Palestine will bear the fruit of its struggles, and the Israeli terrorist organization will bear the fruit of their genocide, massacre, and oppression.

# **The perception of a strong Israel collapsed with Hamas’s October 7th attack.**
