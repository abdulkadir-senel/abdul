Culture is a factory of words, and this factory is fed by nature. Without raw material, which is nature, it cannot produce goods. Arbitrariness claims that there is no need for raw material, which is a ridiculous idea.
Besides that, arbitrariness argues that if raw material (nature) is the same for everyone, then why are there so many different products? If both the material and the factory were the same, there should not be such variation. This analogy represents the argument of arbitrariness, which questions why different languages have different words for the same object — for example, why English calls a tree “tree,” while Arabic calls it “şecere.”
We would answer that their raw material is not the same. A tree in Britain does not look like a tree in an Arabic-speaking region. This alone would be enough to refute the argument, but let’s dive a little deeper. The factories are also not the same. Because the Arabic environment is different, their perception of the world is different, leading to the development of a different language. On the other hand, the English environment shaped the English mind, and the English mind created the English language. For this reason, language is indirectly connected to nature.
