In English, there is only one word for both *“sen”* and *“siz”* in Turkish: *“you.”“You”* is used to address your conversational partner directly. Turkish also has a direct address system, but *“sen”* is used for a single person who is close to you or at a low social distance (e.g., *“Hey, you are in my team”*). On the other hand, *“siz”* is used either for multiple people (e.g., *“Hey, you all are in my team”*) or for someone at a higher social distance (e.g., *“You are my professor”*).

For me, the key point is not *how* they differ but *why* such a difference exists.

The answer is simple: **cultures are different.** English culture is more individual-oriented, whereas Turkish culture is more collective-oriented. In Turkish culture, indicating social position is crucial for maintaining harmony. You must show respect, especially to elders, and this respect is so important that it shapes the language itself — creating a distinct word (*“siz”*) to convey that respect. In English, however, respect is not as deeply embedded in social interactions, so the language never developed a separate formal pronoun.

Interestingly, English *did* have a similar distinction in the past: *“thou”* was used like *“sen”* (informal, singular), while *“you”* was used like *“siz”* (formal or plural). But as culture changed, the language did too. Over time, hyper-politeness in English led to the disappearance of the informal *“thou.”*

**When culture changes, language follows.**
