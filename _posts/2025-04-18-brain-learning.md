From the invention of the computer until now — and still today — some people compare computers with the human brain. Not just people in cafés, but also scientists and scholars in labs and colleges have used the same tool to talk about the brain. Actually, before insulting them for being completely wrong, it’s worth admitting that thinking of the brain as a computer is quite straightforward. There is no other known existence in the universe that performs similar tasks in a way humans can understand. Some animals do similar things, but we still don’t fully understand how even their brains work.

Computers store and retrieve information, calculate numbers, and so on. However, despite these surface-level similarities, the brain and computer work in completely different ways.

We often talk about the brain as if it were a computer. We use terms like “storage region” or “visual processing region.” These may be somewhat appropriate, but the brain does not store information like a computer does. There is no SSD in our head. Our brain stores information in a completely different way. Computers store data statically, meaning you can retrieve the exact same data even 500 years later. However, in the other side, human is quit forgetfull, you might forget what you ate even in this morning — because memory in the brain is not static, it’s dynamic. The information you “store” in your brain lives with you and changes with you. 
Information that we have stored in the brain different than computers that we store information with neurological connection. There is two already existed neurons, but new info comes, this two neuron connect with different way and this is how info stored in brain.
The neurological connections themselves *are* the information. Neurons don’t store data individually — the connections between them *are* the memory.

For example, when you learn that camels have three lips, new connections form across your brain. A neuron at the top of your brain might connect to another on the other side. That pathway *is* the information. The “road” between the two neurons is the memory of the camel’s three lips. How it is more easy to remember 3 lips camel than what ate in morning? Because that information is quite interesting, your mind directs more attention to it. More attention means more neurons are activated in that moment. More neurons mean more connections are formed. That’s why you don’t easily forget it. On the other hand, what you ate this morning isn’t that interesting, so your brain doesn’t focus on it. Fewer neurons are activated, fewer connections are made, so it’s easy to forget.

It’s the same when we learn languages. Learning a language is actually learning which words represent which concepts. The word *“smile”* in English represents something like this: “:)”. But you know that you won’t remember that *“:)”* means *“gülümseme”* in Turkish - tomorrow — or even 3 minutes later — just by looking at it once. Because you are not a computer. Your brain needs to form neurological connections in order to retain that information. And if you didn’t pay much attention — which is natural when something isn’t very interesting — then not many connections will be formed.

So how do you remember that *“gülümseme”* means *“:)”*? The best way is to put it into an interesting context — or at least *some* context. When you read a story, something interesting happens in your brain. Your brain creates a whole new world. A lot of neurons are activated, becasue you are creating entire world in your brain. So if you create a **story** that includes *“gülümseme”*, you’ll be much more likely to remember it. While reading that story, a lot of neurons are activated, and those neurons are exposed to *“gülümseme = :)”*. In the end, you’ll learn that word. If you do this 4,000 times, you’ll eventually learn the Turkish language.

Actually, I realize now that this idea is very similar to Krashen’s “Noticing Hypothesis.” During my undergraduate years, we talked about it a lot. Somehow, I’ve reinvented the Noticing Hypothesis — just from a more neuroscientific perspective.
