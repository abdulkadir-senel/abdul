This is the year 2025. When we look at the sky at night, we may dream about being an interstellar species. But when we look down at the ground, we will see the blood.
If you were in 500 BC in the Mediterranean Sea, you would say that the world is evolving so rapidly, and one of the essences of humanity — morality — will spread everywhere. No one will harm anyone. Humanity is evolving, and humans will not let evil spread around. If you were in those times, you would say, “I would not let anyone harm any innocent.” You would think, “Why would humans harm innocents? And if some evils hurt others, for sure the rest of the world would step up to stop it.”
Actually, there were atrocities happening at those times, but you would not be aware of them, happening very far from you, and you wouldn’t have the ability to see those things. So you would not lose your humanity because you didn’t try to prevent them.
Even in World War I and World War II, you would not be responsible for atrocities, because first, you would not be aware of them; second, you couldn’t do anything to prevent them. You didn’t have guns, you didn’t have cars, you didn’t have money. You had your cow and your fields.
However, it is the year 2025. And we are watching the livestream of the genocide of innocents. People are dying from intentional starvation. There are evils that do not let food reach the children. One million children are dying because those evils do not let food go to them. This is happening right now, in front of everyone.
It is the year 2025. We are watching it. We are seeing babies whose bones can be counted because of starvation.
It is the year 2025. You can’t say, “I don’t see it” or “I didn’t know it.” We know it. We are seeing it. Every human is 99 percent the same. You are not small. Your effect may be small, but every human is the same. The value of a human is not just what they achieved. It’s also what they could not achieve. We should not forget that failure gives birth to success. One can be successful by saying, “I was supporting Palestinians. I was against genocide. I did this, this, and this.” This shows how you are thinking.
What is “this, this, and this”?
One can speak about Gaza and genocide with oneself. Start the voice recorder and speak about it. Do it several times. Later, go onto the internet and write in some forums about Gaza. While you are fighting with evils in forums, you will learn a lot. Later, you can speak with your friends. Ask their ideas. Everyone is like you. But you are looking in the right direction. Turn your friends in that direction and show them the truth.
That would be great. This makes you not one of the silent ones. This makes you one of those who support what’s right, who support the weak.
May you sleep worse because of the atrocities you learned in this process. May you feel extremely sad for those people. But you will feel yourself as a warrior. You will feel your brain and heart working. You are not a robot. You are human.
You achieved to preserve your humanity.
