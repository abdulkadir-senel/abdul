Every year, about **nine million people die from hunger**. This is not a distant statistic; it is a repeating human tragedy that overshadows most wars or natural disasters. Meanwhile, the U.S. spends around **$25 billion annually on NASA**. According to the UN World Food Programme, about **$5 billion a year could end global hunger**.
Accordign to UN World Food Program in Africa, 1.50$ is enough for someone daily. yearly 547$ per human, 547*9.000.000 = 4.923.000.000.   this makes **$** 5 billion. 
 That means just one fifth of government agency’s yearly budget could cover most of the cost of solving one of the greatest problems humanity faces.

Supporters of space exploration often argue that NASA’s budget is “tiny” compared to the federal budget. In percentage terms, that is true. But the fact that it is considered small actually strengthens the point: even what governments view as a minor expense could change millions of lives if redirected. A “tiny” slice of national spending is enormous on the scale of human survival.

We cannot control how billionaires spend their fortune, but NASA is publicly funded. Taxpayers have the right to question whether the pursuit of distant planets should take precedence over addressing hunger here on Earth. Ending starvation would not just save lives—it would stand as one of humanity’s greatest achievements. Before we look outward, perhaps we should first prove we can care for those at home.
