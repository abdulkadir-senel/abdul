When people discuss the problem of evil, they often bring up animal suffering. For millions of years, creatures have felt pain—dinosaurs crushed by meteorites, animals starving, microbes destroyed by the billions. Some even argue that animal suffering is especially troubling because it does not affect the divine test of humankind. If pain is meant to teach or to test humans, then why do animals suffer at all? Doesn’t that seem unnecessary, even unfair?

But this argument overlooks a crucial truth: human pain and animal pain are not the same. Humans are not just another biological species. We are immensely different from even our closest relatives. No animal has ever built civilization, created art, discovered science, or shaped history the way humans have. Our existence is not just biology—it is will, meaning, and culture. Civilization itself proves that humanity cannot be reduced to mere biology.

Animals, by contrast, live according to natural law. Their pain is more like a reaction than an experience of moral weight—no different in principle from a tree bending in the wind or a rock making a sound when struck. We may feel compassion when we see animals suffer, but that does not mean their pain carries the same moral or spiritual significance as human suffering.

This is why animal pain, however real, does not stand at the center of the problem of evil. Human suffering is unique because human life is unique. To treat the two as equal is to blur the immense gap between humankind and all other creatures.
