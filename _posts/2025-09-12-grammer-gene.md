So, here’s something I’ve been thinking about. How did language evolve, and how did language science evolve? Let’s start with language science and how linguists think about language learning, especially how babies learn language.

Back in the 1950s, behaviorist learning theories were popular. They proposed that we learn through reward and punishment. Noam Chomsky, however, argued that language couldn't be learned solely from behaviorist ideas like rewards or punishments.1 Babies pick up language far too easily for that. Think about it: no one sits down with a two-year-old and teaches them grammar rules. Yet, somehow, they start speaking in full sentences.

Because we learn languages so much more easily than their complexity would suggest, Chomsky proposed that our brains are built for language—that it’s hard-wired into us.2 Since there are 7,000 languages, it’s not common sense to think that every single one is hard-wired. So, he suggested that all languages share some universal structure, a common backbone, with differences built upon this foundation.3 He pointed to **recursion**—the ability to embed sentences within sentences—as proof. For example, "that car which he has, which she met, which I love, which makes stupid jokes, which I adapted from comics." Because language is innate, it means it is part of our genome, and we are born with it.4

So, how did it first appear in our genome? Was it through adaptation or mutation? A slow, successive modification, or a sudden, lucky mutation that conquered all humans? Chomsky said that because archaeological analysis suggests language probably appeared 150,000 years ago, and because no related animals have a similar skill, it likely emerged from a mutation. We know that eyes also emerged from a mutation; nearly all new traits emerged from a mutation, and luck made them relevant in advanced generations.

But then there’s Vyvyan Evans, who pushes back. He says, “Hold on, kids don’t actually learn language *that*quickly.” It takes trial, error, repetition, and a lot of time. If it’s slow and messy, does that really mean it’s innate? Evans argues that language (grammer-recursion) is not innate.5 Therefore, it’s not part of our genome, and the physical features of humans today are the result of a long biological process of adaptation. Evans suggests that *Homo*species changed their diet to meat two million years ago. They needed to hunt and, therefore, needed to work together and communicate. This need is what led to the language we use today.

Which is the better explanation? Firstly, evolution is not as simple as Evans makes it sound. In evolution, the role of chance is huge, so a simple story of language evolving through adaptation isn't that convincing. Also, there’s a question for Chomsky: do babies really learn language so fast that we should call it innate? So I think the main points are: Are babies so smart that they can learn a complex language, or are languages not complex enough to need an innate mechanism? 
further note; creolization is look like brightest evidence for innateness of grammer. because baby hear pidgin language (very pirimitive language, specially occur multilanguage communities) and they start to speak advanced version of that langugae - creola. they create the complex human language from pirimitive language
