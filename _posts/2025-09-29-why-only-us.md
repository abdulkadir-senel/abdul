In the book "Why Only Us," Chomsky argues that language is not primarily for communication. Language's main job is not communicating; rather, it helps with the complex thought processes of the mind. It functions more as an internal tool. 

The book suggests there's a feature of the brain that performs complex hierarchical processes, and language is one of these processes. It proposes that this specific feature or tool of the brain is language itself. In this view, language as we commonly know it is a byproduct of this mental tool.

The authors delve so deeply into these concepts that the distinctions become blurry, as everything appears interdependent, interchangeable, and connected.

Let's take a step back. Most of us know language as a tool for communication—though not the only communication tool, as we also use gestures, facial expressions, and so on.

There's something unique about language that sets humans apart from other animals: its hierarchical structure. It's not just simple phrases like "an apple" or "red school," but complex constructions like "I quickly go to the hugely interesting red school."

This non-linear, hierarchical complexity of human language distinguishes it from other natural communication tools.

Let's dive deeper. We know that the hierarchical feature of language makes it unique, and as mentioned in the book, this is the core of language. So language is basically a hierarchical structure.

But the book also says that language is a mental tool—a tool for thought. Language is described as a kind of organ.

This suggests that language is one part of our brain, and its feature is creating complex hierarchical structures. The language we speak and read is one of its byproducts.

According to the book, the language is also a mental tool, which means it may perform other tasks requiring hierarchical, complex thinking.

So ultimately, the book transforms our understanding of language into the concept of a "language organ." The book discusses the language organ and language as if they're the same thing.

As mentioned earlier, the distinctions become blurry, interchangeable, and indistinguishable. Language as we commonly understand it is a byproduct of the language organ—perhaps its most well-known manifestation.
